# Wordpress Starter Theme
A starter theme for kicking off WP projects. It's based upon the [Timber framework](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/) for speeding up the development process.

npm install or npm i
```

## Development

```npm run dev
npm run dev
```
The development evironment uses Webpack to handle CSS, JS, SVG,... . [Browsersync](https://github.com/Browsersync/browser-sync) is used to reload the page after a change has been made to CSS, JS, PHP & Twig files.
